# Spring Countdown - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview

**Name:** Spring Countdown
**Description:** A joyful PWA celebrating the return of longer days, counting down to spring equinox and DST, with sunlight tracking and social sharing
**Repository:** https://github.com/billburkey/spring (TBD)
**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2, KV, Workers AI, TypeScript, HTML/CSS

### Key Dates
- **Winter Solstice:** December 21, 2024 (shortest day - starting point!)
- **DST Spring Forward:** March 9, 2025 (2:00 AM local time)
- **Spring Equinox:** March 20, 2025 (5:01 AM EDT)

### Architecture Decisions
- Cloudflare Workers (NOT Pages) for full backend control
- D1 for user preferences and location data
- KV for caching sunrise/sunset calculations
- R2 for storing generated share images
- Workers AI for generating daily celebratory messages
- PWA for offline support and installability
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (single source of truth)

### Design Philosophy
- Joyful, optimistic, warm aesthetic
- Celebrate every minute of gained sunlight
- Make waiting for spring fun and social
- Mobile-first, works everywhere

## Session Log

### Session: 2025-12-22 (Initialization)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Feature worked on:** Project initialization and scaffolding

### Work Completed
- Created feature-list.json with 42 granular features across 10 categories
- Created claude-progress.txt for session tracking
- Initialized git repository
- Set up complete Cloudflare Workers project structure:
  - package.json with Hono framework, TypeScript, Vitest
  - wrangler.toml with D1, KV, R2, Workers AI bindings configured
  - tsconfig.json for TypeScript compilation
  - src/index.ts with basic countdown API and UI
  - PWA manifest.json and service worker (sw.js)
  - D1 migration with user_preferences, visit_streaks, site_stats, fun_facts tables
- Installed dependencies (npm install completed)
- Made initial commits

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight, fast, Cloudflare-native)
- **Cloudflare Workers** (not Pages) per user requirement
- **D1 schema**: User preferences, streaks, fun facts for engagement
- **PWA**: Service worker with cache-first for static, network-first for API
- **UI**: Warm spring color palette (gold, orange, sky blue, spring green)

### Commits Made
- `b511f42`: feat: initialize Spring Countdown project (12 files)
- `b8b5c97`: chore: add package-lock.json

### Environment State
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] Wrangler project created (structure ready)
- [ ] D1 database created (need: wrangler d1 create spring-db)
- [ ] KV namespace created (need: wrangler kv:namespace create SPRING_KV)
- [ ] R2 bucket created (need: wrangler r2 bucket create spring-images)
- [ ] GitHub repository created and connected

### Next Session Should
1. Create GitHub repository and push code
2. Create Cloudflare resources (D1, KV, R2)
3. Update wrangler.toml with actual resource IDs
4. Run D1 migration
5. Test local development with `npm run dev`
6. Begin implementing core-001 (Spring equinox countdown with animation)

### Blockers
- None currently

### Session: 2025-12-22 (Feature Implementation)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Feature worked on:** Core astronomy features and UI

### Work Completed
- Added 8 astronomy features to feature-list.json (now 50 total features)
- Created src/utils/sun.ts - comprehensive sunrise/sunset/daylight calculations
- Created src/utils/moon.ts - moon phase, illumination, zodiac calculations
- Created src/data/constellations.ts - 15 constellations with visibility calculations
- Created src/data/sky-lore.ts - ancient astronomy, cultural traditions, upcoming events
- Completely rewrote src/index.ts with distinctive UI:
  - Night sky theme with warm gold/amber accents
  - Animated glowing sun with rotating rays
  - Twinkling starfield background (100 stars)
  - Fraunces (display) + Outfit (body) typography
  - Glass-morphism cards with hover effects
  - Full API endpoints for all data
  - PWA-ready with manifest and service worker
- TypeScript compiles cleanly

### Technical Decisions
- Using suncalc library for astronomical calculations
- Local constellation visibility based on sidereal time
- Sky lore rotates daily based on day-of-year hash
- API returns all data in single /api/data call for efficiency
- Countdown updates via separate /api/countdown (every second)

### Commits Made
- `7c4e7c3`: feat: add astronomy features to feature list
- `fb0b967`: feat: implement core astronomy features and distinctive UI

### Features Partially Complete
- data-001: Sunrise/sunset calculation engine ✅
- astro-001: Moon phase display ✅
- astro-002: Visible constellations ✅
- astro-005: Ancient astronomy/sky lore ✅
- ui-002: Distinctive visual theme ✅
- core-001: Spring countdown ✅
- core-002: DST countdown ✅

### Environment State
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] Wrangler project created
- [x] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] D1 database created (need: wrangler d1 create spring-db)
- [ ] KV namespace created (need: wrangler kv:namespace create SPRING_KV)
- [ ] R2 bucket created (need: wrangler r2 bucket create spring-images)
- [ ] GitHub repository created and connected
- [ ] Dev server tested locally

### Next Session Should
1. Create GitHub repository (git remote add origin...)
