# Spring Countdown - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview

**Name:** Spring Countdown
**Description:** A joyful PWA celebrating the return of longer days, counting down to spring equinox and DST, with sunlight tracking and social sharing
**Repository:** https://github.com/billburkey/spring (TBD)
**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2, KV, Workers AI, TypeScript, HTML/CSS

### Key Dates
- **Winter Solstice:** December 21, 2024 (shortest day - starting point!)
- **DST Spring Forward:** March 9, 2025 (2:00 AM local time)
- **Spring Equinox:** March 20, 2025 (5:01 AM EDT)

### Architecture Decisions
- Cloudflare Workers (NOT Pages) for full backend control
- D1 for user preferences and location data
- KV for caching sunrise/sunset calculations
- R2 for storing generated share images
- Workers AI for generating daily celebratory messages
- PWA for offline support and installability
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (single source of truth)

### Design Philosophy
- Joyful, optimistic, warm aesthetic
- Celebrate every minute of gained sunlight
- Make waiting for spring fun and social
- Mobile-first, works everywhere

## Session Log

### Session: 2025-12-22 (Initialization)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Feature worked on:** Project initialization and scaffolding

### Work Completed
- Created feature-list.json with 42 granular features across 10 categories
- Created claude-progress.txt for session tracking
- Initialized git repository
- Set up complete Cloudflare Workers project structure:
  - package.json with Hono framework, TypeScript, Vitest
  - wrangler.toml with D1, KV, R2, Workers AI bindings configured
  - tsconfig.json for TypeScript compilation
  - src/index.ts with basic countdown API and UI
  - PWA manifest.json and service worker (sw.js)
  - D1 migration with user_preferences, visit_streaks, site_stats, fun_facts tables
- Installed dependencies (npm install completed)
- Made initial commits

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight, fast, Cloudflare-native)
- **Cloudflare Workers** (not Pages) per user requirement
- **D1 schema**: User preferences, streaks, fun facts for engagement
- **PWA**: Service worker with cache-first for static, network-first for API
- **UI**: Warm spring color palette (gold, orange, sky blue, spring green)

### Commits Made
- `b511f42`: feat: initialize Spring Countdown project (12 files)
- `b8b5c97`: chore: add package-lock.json

### Environment State
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] Wrangler project created (structure ready)
- [ ] D1 database created (need: wrangler d1 create spring-db)
- [ ] KV namespace created (need: wrangler kv:namespace create SPRING_KV)
- [ ] R2 bucket created (need: wrangler r2 bucket create spring-images)
- [ ] GitHub repository created and connected

### Next Session Should
1. Create GitHub repository and push code
2. Create Cloudflare resources (D1, KV, R2)
3. Update wrangler.toml with actual resource IDs
4. Run D1 migration
5. Test local development with `npm run dev`
6. Begin implementing core-001 (Spring equinox countdown with animation)

### Blockers
- None currently
