# Spring Countdown - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview

**Name:** Spring Countdown
**Description:** A joyful PWA celebrating the return of longer days, counting down to spring equinox and DST, with sunlight tracking and social sharing
**Repository:** https://github.com/billburkey/spring (TBD)
**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2, KV, Workers AI, TypeScript, HTML/CSS

### Key Dates
- **Winter Solstice:** December 21, 2024 (shortest day - starting point!)
- **DST Spring Forward:** March 9, 2025 (2:00 AM local time)
- **Spring Equinox:** March 20, 2025 (5:01 AM EDT)

### Architecture Decisions
- Cloudflare Workers (NOT Pages) for full backend control
- D1 for user preferences and location data
- KV for caching sunrise/sunset calculations
- R2 for storing generated share images
- Workers AI for generating daily celebratory messages
- PWA for offline support and installability
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (single source of truth)

### Design Philosophy
- Joyful, optimistic, warm aesthetic
- Celebrate every minute of gained sunlight
- Make waiting for spring fun and social
- Mobile-first, works everywhere

- Will implement sunrise/sunset calculations locally (no external API dependency)
- PWA-first approach for offline and installability

### Next Steps
1. Initialize git repository
2. Set up Cloudflare Workers project structure
3. Begin with core countdown functionality (core-001, core-002)

### Environment State
